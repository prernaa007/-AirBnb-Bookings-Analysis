**Introductiom**

As the sharing economy grows, Airbnb has emerged as one of the most popular platforms for short-term lodging rentals. Since its launch in 2008, Airbnb has transformed the way people travel and explore the world by offering a diverse range of unique and personalized accommodations. From apartments and houses to castles and treehouses, Airbnb listings span across the globe, providing travelers with a more local and authentic experience.

With millions of users and hosts interacting daily, Airbnb generates an immense amount of data. Analyzing this data is critical for improving the platform's operations, enhancing customer satisfaction, and driving business strategies. In this project, we explore a dataset of Airbnb listings from New York City for the year 2019. The dataset contains approximately 49,000 listings and includes key information such as property details, host profiles, booking trends, and pricing.

Through data exploration, visualization, and analysis, this project aims to:

Uncover patterns and trends in booking behaviors
Identify factors that influence pricing and availability
Provide insights into customer preferences
Explore geographic and seasonal trends in Airbnb usage
By the end of this analysis, we will generate actionable insights that can help hosts optimize their listings and Airbnb make informed business decisions. The findings will also serve as a basis for further investigations into user behavior and platform performance.

**Problem statement:**

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analyzed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more.
